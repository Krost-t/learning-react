# Travel Journal 🌍

This project is a travel journal built with React, allowing users to document and explore various travel destinations. It serves as an introduction to React, covering fundamental concepts such as setting up a project, JSX, custom components, and styling.

## 📚 What I Learned:

### ✅ Why Reusability is Important

Reusability in React allows for efficient code management, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability. Using reusable components makes development faster and more scalable.

### 🛠️ Props

Props (short for "properties") allow components to receive data from their parent components. They help make components dynamic and reusable. Example:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

Props enable data-driven UI rendering and component communication.

### 🔄 Creating Components from an Array of Data

Instead of hardcoding elements, React allows dynamically generating components from an array using the `.map()` method. Example:

```jsx
const items = ["Paris", "New York", "Tokyo"];
const DestinationList = () => (
  <ul>
    {items.map((destination, index) => (
      <li key={index}>{destination}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

This approach improves scalability and simplifies data-driven UI rendering.
